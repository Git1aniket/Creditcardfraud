Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It uses a real-world dataset and applies various models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

🔍 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions.

📁 Dataset
